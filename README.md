===============================

Open index.html to load the game. If you run the file locally, you will need to set up a local server.
You can do it with python for example.

Playing the game is simple: choose the character you want to play with by clicking on it, and then use
the top, right, bottom and left arrows to move your character in the respective directions. The aim is
to reach the top row (water tiles) without colliding with a rushing bug!
