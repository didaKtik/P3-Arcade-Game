Project 3: Arcade game "Frogger"
===============================
Have you ever dreamt of a game that would train you road-crossing capabilities?
Maybe on this day when you had to cross this two-times-three-lane
highway with your mosquito costume to grab your favourite hamburger? Whatever
the good reason, this game is made for you!

No in fact this is primarily an excuse to train object-oriented programming
with js (master this *this* guy, experience with scopes, classes and their
prototype, inheritance, etc.). It is part of [Udacity's front-end nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001),
and as such you also learn plenty of other practical things on the way, like
writting with Markdown.

## Starting the game
Open index.html to load the game. If you run the file locally, you will need
to set up a local server. You can [do it with python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html)
for example.

## Playing the game
Playing the game is simple: choose the character you want to play with by clicking on it, and then use
the top, right, bottom and left arrows to move your character in the respective directions. The aim is
to reach the top row (water tiles) without colliding with a rushing bug!
